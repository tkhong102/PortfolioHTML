						<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Hi there! <br>
					My name is Thuydung Khong. I am currently studying software development at Zip Code Wilmington.
					I consider myself to be a very creative person, and this is reflected in my hobbies. I express
					my creativity though photography, cooking/baking, and needlecrafts such as knitting. These
					hobbies require that I follow a set of directions but allowing me  ample of room to express
					my creativity just as I software development is allowing me to do. <br>
					In addition to being known for being creative, I was also considered a very tech-savy person in
					all of my previous positions. I am persuing a career in software engineer is because I can see
					the limitless potential in the field and I want to apply my creativity and my tech-savy skills
					in making a difference in our future.<br>

						<h2>My Coding Projects</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Below are links to some of the coding projects I have been working on, either individually
						or in a team: <br></p>
						<a href="assets/images/assets/images/lgCalculator.png" ><img src="assets/images/tinyCalculator.jpg"  alt="Scientific Calulator"/></a>
						<h3><a href="https://github.com/tkhong102/Calculator-App">Scientific Calculator Project</a></h3>
						<p>On day 6 of the Zip Code Wilmington program, we were assigned the Scientific Calculator project.
						We worked on a team of 3 people using only Java in the beginning then incorporating JavaFX individually
						for the user interface. I was responsible for creating the methods for the calculations.
						I've always known the power behind a few lines of codes, but even as small as this project was,
						I was really amazed seeing how our team's codes build up line by line into something functional.
						This little project really motivated me to push myself harder, to learn more, to build bigger,
						better applications.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/tkhong102/Calculator-App"> Casino Project</a></h3>
					<p>In the Casino project we worked as a team of 6 people responsible for creating 3 casino games.
					I worked on the blackjack game along with another teammate. As much as I like working on my own,
					I find that I like working on a team just as much. I find that when I work on a team, I push
					myself harder to meet my teammates' expectations, I get a lot of support from my teammates when
					I need it, and seeing the different ways code to come to the same conclusion made me reevaluate
					myself and my codes so that I can be a better developer.</p>

					<a href="assets/images/lgPassion.png" ><img src="assets/images/tinyPassion.jpg"  alt="Passion Project"/></a>
					<h3><a href="tkhong102.github.io">Passion Project</a></h3>
					<p>As part of the Zip Code Wilmington program curriculum, each student is required to come up
					with an idea for an application with a topic that we are passionate about, called the Passion
					Project. For my project, I wanted to build an Instagram copycat because I love photography.
					I love that through photographs you can share all the life's great moments
					and amazing ideas. As great as Instagram is already, there are a few things I would like
					to change to customize my preferences as a user.</p>
