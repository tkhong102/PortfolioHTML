						<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Hi there! <br>
					My name is Thuydung Khong. I am currently studying software development at ZipCode Wilmington.
					I consider myself to be a very creative person, and this is reflected in my hobbies. I express
					my creativity though photography, cooking/baking, and needlecrafts such as knitting. These
					hobbies allow me to express my creativity just as I software development is allowing me to do. <br>
					In addition to being known for being creative, I was also considered a very tech-savy person in
					all of my previous positions. I am persuing a career in software engineer is because I can see
					the limitless potential in the field and I want to apply my creativity and my tech-savy skills
					in making a difference in our future.<br>

						<h2>My Interests</h2>
					</header>
					<p>As I mentioned previously, my hobbies include photography, cooking/baking, and needlecrafts.<br>
						Have you ever looked at a photograph that makes you smile or even laugh out loud? Maybe it makes you feel
						upset or emotional. Photography allows me to capture and share all of the wonderful moments in life and all
						of the wonders of this world. It allows people to see the world through my eyes just as I can see others'
						through their photos.
						 <br>
						As for cooking and baking, who doesn't appreciate a good meal or a delicious treat made by a family member or
						friend? I find that food really brings people together and makes people happy. I enjoy experimenting with recipes,
						customizing them to my liking (or to the people I am cooking for). I also really enjoy seeing how all the
						ingredients come together in the end to create a delicious dish.<br>
						Similar to cooking, I think that my interest in knitting stems from the satisfaction I get seeing
						how a piece of garment or a stuffed animal come together row by row from a ball of yarn, needles, and time.
						It is a wonderful feeling to see how much the recipients appreciate these products knowing that I crafted
						the products while thinking of them.

						<h2>My Coding Projects</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Below are links to some of the coding projects I have been working on, either individually
							or in a team: <br></p>
							<a href="assets/images/assets/images/lgCalculator.png" ><img src="assets/images/tinyCalculator.jpg"  alt="Scientific Calulator"/></a>
							<h3><a href="https://github.com/tkhong102/Calculator-App">Scientific Calculator Project</a></h3>
							<p>On day 6 of the Zip Code Wilmington program, we were assigned the Scientific Calculator project.
							We worked on a team of 3 people using only Java in the beginning then incorporating JavaFX individually
							for the user interface. I was responsible for creating the methods for the calculations.
							I've always known the power behind a few lines of codes, but even as small as this project was,
							I was really amazed seeing how our team's codes build up line by line into something functional.
							This little project really motivated me to push myself harder, to learn more, to build bigger,
							better applications.</p>

						<a href="assets/images/lgCasino.png" ><img src="assets/images/tinyCasino.jpg"  alt="Casino Project"/></a>
						<h3><a href="https://github.com/tkhong102/Calculator-App"> Casino Project</a></h3>
						<p>In the Casino project we worked as a team of 6 people responsible for creating 3 casino games.
						I worked on the blackjack game along with another teammate. As much as I like working on my own,
						I find that I like working on a team just as much. I find that when I work on a team, I push
						myself harder to meet my teammates' expectations, I get a lot of support from my teammates when
						I need it, and seeing the different ways code to come to the same conclusion made me reevaluate
						myself and my codes so that I can be a better developer.</p>

						<a href="assets/images/lgPassion.png" ><img src="assets/images/tinyPassion.jpg"  alt="Passion Project"/></a>
						<h3><a href="tkhong102.github.io">Passion Project</a></h3>
						<p>As part of the Zip Code Wilmington program curriculum, each student is required to come up
						with an idea for an application with a topic that we are passionate about, called the Passion
						Project. For my project, I wanted to build an Instagram copycat because I love photography.
						I love that through photographs you can share all the life's great moments
						and amazing ideas. As great as Instagram is already, there are a few things I would like
						to change to customize my preferences as a user.</p>
